Problem 15: Lattice paths
Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

  >>>>>a diagram of 6 2 by 2 grids showing all the routes to the bottom right corner<<<<<

How many such routes are there through a given gridSize?
