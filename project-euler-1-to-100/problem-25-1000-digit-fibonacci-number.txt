Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:

          F1 = 1
          F2 = 1
          F3 = 2
          F4 = 3
          F5 = 5
          F6 = 8
          F7 = 13
          F8 = 21
          F9 = 34
          F10 = 55
          F11 = 89
          F12 = 144
The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain n digits?
