/*
Problem 28: Number spiral diagonals
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an n by n spiral formed in the same way?
